The speech-to-song illusion is a perceptual phenomenon where, when repeated multiple times, a segment of speech begins to be perceived as song-like. We want to test an individual's receptiveness to the speech-to-song illusion by measuring their musicality ratings for repeated speech segments compared to control stimuli. Will people enjoy the sounds of the song-like stimuli more after repetition? Musical anhedonia is a special population where individuals do not feel emotion or chills when listening to any music. We are curious to see if those with musical anhedonia – or, those who are more anhedonic than others – are less receptive to the speech-to-song illusion. Another one of our goals is to see if those with musical anhedonia dislike the final songlike stimuli, specifically compared to the enjoyment of those who are not anhedonic.
